## [Link to the app](https://jltyler.github.io/taco-bell-meal-front)

## Maximize your Taco Bell® trip efficiency!
A SPA that interacts with the [Taco Bell® Meals API](https://github.com/jltyler/taco-bell-meal-api) to let you create meals consisting of Taco Bell® menu items and save those meals. Counts up the total price for your list of Taco Bell® menu items and displays it for you. Also comes with a garish Taco Bell® color scheme and obnoxious Taco Bell® sound effects.

## Process
- Plan out back end with ERD diagram
- Plan out front end with wireframe
- Establish and implement routes for API
- Test routes on API using curl
- Create basic layout with temporary forms
- Implement AJAX calls to API and test them
- Remove all temporary forms
- Use Bootstrap to make things smoother
- Style front end in Taco Bell® colors
- Add obnoxious sound effects

## Problems
I ran into an issue when I realized I needed some custom routes that did not use the standard CRUD names or actions. I implemented these and things went fairly smoothly afterwards.

## User stories
As a user...
- I can see a list of Taco Bell® menu items and their prices
- I can have multiple lists consisting of multiple Taco Bell® menu items
- I can add Taco Bell® menu items to a list
- I can save Taco Bell® menu items to a list and recall it later
- I can see the total price of all the Taco Bell® menu items in a list
